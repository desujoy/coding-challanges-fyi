# Coding Challenges Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing coding challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi) as I learn Go.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to improve my problem-solving skills and proficiency in the Go programming language by solving various coding challenges.

## Structure

- Each challenge will have its own directory.
- The directory will contain:
    - A `README.md` file with the challenge description.
    - The Go solution file(s).
    - Any additional files required for the solution.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-challenges-fyi.git
        ```
2. Navigate to the challenge directory:
        ```sh
        cd coding-challenges-fyi/challenge-name
        ```
3. Run the Go solution:
        ```sh
        go run main.go
        ```
